# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Summary

Calibrate Backend is a FastAPI REST API that wraps the `calibrate` CLI tool to orchestrate long-running evaluation and simulation jobs:

1. **STT/TTS evaluation** — benchmark speech providers against datasets
2. **LLM agent testing** — unit tests and multi-model benchmarks
3. **Voice/chat simulations** — simulated conversations between AI agents and personas across scenarios

The backend persists state in SQLite, stores artifacts in S3, and spawns `calibrate` CLI subprocesses to do the actual work. Authentication is Google OAuth or email/password, gated by JWTs.

## Required Reading

Before making changes, read `.cursor/rules/architecture.md`. It is the canonical, exhaustive reference for the DB schema, API surface, job lifecycle, queueing, process management, abort/timeout semantics, and non-obvious gotchas (SQLite `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` migration limits, UTC timestamp handling, exact-match model-folder mapping, race conditions in the simulation abort path, etc.). Do not reinvent those details from the code — they are load-bearing.

Other relevant rules in `.cursor/rules/`:

- `env-var.md` — **when adding/changing/removing env vars, also update `src/.env.example`, `docker-compose.yml`, and the GitHub Actions workflows**
- `design.md` — frontend design tokens (mostly not relevant to this backend repo)
- `context-first.md` — enforces reading `architecture.md` first

## Commands

Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync --frozen
```

Run the dev server (note the `cd src` — the app is run from inside `src/`, not the repo root):

```bash
cd src
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

API at http://localhost:8000, docs at http://localhost:8000/docs (HTTP Basic Auth, credentials from `DOCS_USERNAME`/`DOCS_PASSWORD`, default `admin`/`changeme`).

Docker:

```bash
docker build -t calibrate-backend .
docker-compose up -d
```

There is no test suite, linter, or formatter configured in `pyproject.toml`.

## Code Layout

All application code lives under `src/` and runs with `src/` as the working directory (see Dockerfile). Imports are flat (`from db import ...`, `from auth_utils import ...`) — there is no package namespace.

- `src/main.py` — FastAPI app, lifespan hooks (job recovery on startup), custom HTTP-Basic-auth'd `/docs` routes, Sentry/OTEL setup
- `src/db.py` — single-file SQLite layer (~3400 lines). All schema DDL, migrations (wrapped in `try/except sqlite3.OperationalError` — see architecture.md gotcha on `DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`), and CRUD. Soft deletes (`deleted_at IS NULL` filter) everywhere.
- `src/utils.py` — S3 helpers, presigned URLs, `build_tool_configs()`, process-group kill helpers, job-queue registry (`register_job_starter`, `can_start_*_job`, `try_start_queued_*_job`), `TaskStatus` enum, `is_job_timed_out()`, Sentry capture helper
- `src/auth_utils.py` — JWT verification, `get_current_user_id` dependency, `require_superadmin`
- `src/dataset_utils.py` — `resolve_dataset_inputs()` / `inject_dataset_item_ids()` shared by STT and TTS routers
- `src/job_recovery.py` — on startup, kills orphaned process groups and restarts `in_progress` jobs
- `src/llm_judge.py` — `{{variable}}` template rendering, OpenRouter-based judge invocation, and `build_evaluator_cli_payload()` that shapes linked evaluators into the dict sent to the calibrate CLI (STT/TTS/LLM tests/simulations all share this).
- `src/routers/` — one file per resource. Each router registers a job starter via `register_job_starter(...)` at module load so `try_start_queued_*_job` can resume queued work.

## Architectural Load-Bearing Facts

These are the invariants most likely to trip up an edit. The architecture doc has the full explanation; this is the short form.

- **Three independent job queues**: eval (`stt-eval`, `tts-eval`), agent-test (`llm-unit-test`, `llm-benchmark`), simulation (`text`, `voice`). Each enforces both a global and per-user concurrency limit. Every mutation that completes/deletes/aborts a job must call `try_start_queued_*_job(...)` for that queue — otherwise queued work stalls.
- **User scoping is mandatory**: every DB call takes `user_id`, and routers return 404 (not 403) on access-denied to avoid leaking existence. `user_id` on `agent_test_jobs` / `simulation_jobs` is derived by JOIN through the parent entity.
- **SQLite stores UTC**; use `datetime.utcnow()` when comparing against `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` columns. Never `datetime.now()`.
- **Subprocesses**: always start with `start_new_session=True`; store `pid`/`pgid` in job details; kill via `os.killpg` SIGTERM→SIGKILL (catch both `ProcessLookupError` and `PermissionError` on macOS). Agent test jobs are the exception — they block on `process.wait()` and do not track PIDs because `agent_test_jobs` has no `details` column.
- **Polling loops that spawn `calibrate`**: redirect stdout/stderr to temp files (not pipes) to avoid buffer-full deadlocks; poll every 2s; only `update_job` when state actually changes (to preserve `updated_at` for the 5-minute timeout check); read intermediate outputs from disk.
- **Simulation abort**: check `_is_job_aborted(task_id)` at every layer (inside polling loop, inside intermediate-update writer, after loop exit, inside `run_simulation_task`, and all exception handlers). Missing any one re-opens a race where the monitoring thread overwrites the abort state.
- **STT/TTS intermediate results are disk-only** during `in_progress` — error/timeout handlers must call `_collect_intermediate_results()` / `_collect_tts_intermediate_results()` before writing failure to DB, or successful providers' data is lost. Timeout handlers must **merge** (not overwrite) with existing DB `success: true` entries.
- **Presigned URLs are generated on-the-fly** from stored S3 keys — never persist presigned URLs in the DB (they expire). Dataset item audio paths are stored as full `s3://bucket/key` URIs (exception to the bare-key convention); `_presign_audio_path()` handles parsing.
- **Benchmark model-to-folder matching is exact**, not substring. Substring matching previously caused silent cross-model contamination (e.g. `gpt-5.4` absorbing `gpt-5.4-mini`'s results). If the calibrate CLI adds a new folder naming convention, extend the candidate list in `_match_model_to_folder`.
- **`MAX_CONCURRENT_JOBS` default is 1** in `docker-compose.yml`. In practice jobs serialize; this matters when reasoning about the queue.
- **FastAPI upper bound** (`<0.122.0`) in `pyproject.toml` is load-bearing — it's constrained by `calibrate-agent` → `pipecat-ai`. Don't loosen casually.
- **Dockerfile quirk**: `uv sync` installs into `.venv`, so any `RUN python ...` step must be `RUN uv run python ...` (see the `nltk.download('punkt_tab')` line).
- **Evaluators replace `metrics`**: the `metrics` table is frozen — new work goes to `evaluators` + `evaluator_versions`. `evaluators.owner_user_id IS NULL` ⇒ seeded default (visible to everyone, not editable). Custom evaluators duplicate-and-edit. Pivots (`simulation_evaluators`, `test_evaluators`) pin `evaluator_version_id` at link time so the "live version" API only affects *future* links — reruns of old tests keep using the old version. STT/TTS jobs store the same shape inside `details.evaluators` (no pivot table). `init_db()` seeds defaults with stable `slug`s, migrates legacy `metrics` rows into `evaluators` (marked via `source_metric_uuid`), and backfills LLM `tests` where `config.evaluation.type='response'` into a `test_evaluators` link against `default-llm-next-reply` with `variable_values={"criteria": <old text>}`. All three passes are idempotent — safe to rerun.
- **Evaluator shape**: `output_type` ("binary" | "rating") lives on the `evaluators` row — it's identity. The **rubric** (`output_config`, including scale values/labels/descriptions/colors) lives on each `evaluator_versions` row so prompt iterations carry their own pinned rubric. Pivots (`simulation_evaluators`, `test_evaluators`) pin `evaluator_version_id` at link time, so past runs stay reproducible even after the rubric is edited.
- **Evaluator type vs data type**: an evaluator carries **two independent classifying columns** on the `evaluators` row:
  - `evaluator_type` (`tts | stt | llm | simulation`, default `llm`) — semantic category. `tts` judges TTS output; `stt` judges one transcript in isolation; `llm` judges one response with conversation history; `simulation` judges a full conversation. The frontend filters per run context (`GET /evaluators?evaluator_type=stt` on the STT page, etc.).
  - `data_type` (`text | audio`, default `text`) — the medium the judge actually consumes. **This is the only field that gates audio routing** in `invoke_evaluator()` (`data_type == "audio"` ⇒ audio bytes attached to the user message). It's also passed straight through to the calibrate CLI in `build_evaluator_cli_payload()`.
  In practice `tts ⇒ data_type=audio` and the rest are `text`, but the split is preserved so a user can in principle define, e.g., a TTS evaluator that judges a transcribed text instead of audio without reclassifying its category.
  The schema went through an intermediate phase where `data_type` was renamed to `evaluator_type`; `init_db()` now runs both `ALTER TABLE evaluators RENAME COLUMN data_type TO evaluator_type` **and** `ALTER TABLE evaluators ADD COLUMN data_type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'text'` (both try/except guarded — fresh DBs and DBs already on the new schema both no-op). Then it remaps legacy `evaluator_type` values (`audio → tts`, `text → llm`) and backfills `data_type = 'audio' WHERE evaluator_type = 'tts' AND data_type = 'text'` so partially-migrated DBs land in the right place. `_seed_default_evaluators` then snaps each seeded slug to its canonical `(evaluator_type, data_type)` pair. Default seeds: `default-tts-audio-quality` → `(tts, audio)`; `default-stt-transcription` → `(stt, text)`; everything else (`default-llm-next-reply`, `default-faithfulness`, `default-helpfulness`, `default-safety`, `default-conciseness`, `default-instruction-following`) → `(llm, text)`. There is no seeded `simulation` default — users create their own.
- **output_config shape** — same entry form for every output type: `{value, name, description?, color?}`. Binary = 2-entry scale with bool `value`; rating = N≥2-entry with numeric `value`. Adding a new `output_type` (categorical, ranking, …) means a new JSON shape inside `output_config` — no schema change. `variables` also live per-version (they're defined by the prompt text).
- **Per-level rubric injection**: `_format_scale_rubric()` in [llm_judge.py](src/llm_judge.py) appends a `Rubric:\n  value (name): description\n...` block to the judge prompt whenever any scale entry has a `description`. Applied identically for the `/invoke` endpoint and for the calibrate CLI payload (baked into the rendered `system_prompt` of each evaluator entry). Entries without a description are silently skipped — mixed-fill is fine.
- **API keys (`/api-keys`)** use bcrypt; the raw key is returned exactly once on creation and the DB keeps only a `key_prefix` (first 12 chars) for lookup plus the bcrypt hash. `get_user_from_api_key` accepts either `X-API-Key: <key>` or `Authorization: Bearer <key>` (keys are prefixed `calib_` so they can coexist with JWTs in the same header).
- **Evaluator invocation (`POST /evaluators/{uuid}/invoke`)** is the only endpoint that uses API-key auth instead of JWT. It renders `{{variable}}` placeholders against the request's `variables` dict, sends to OpenRouter, and enforces JSON output shape (`{pass, reasoning}` for binary, `{value, reasoning}` for rating, `{winner, reasoning}` for `kind=side_by_side`).
- **Calibrate CLI evaluator handoff** — the calibrate CLI accepts a minimal evaluator definition: `{name, system_prompt, judge_model, type ("binary"|"rating"), scale_min?, scale_max?}`. The backend's stored extras (`evaluator_type`, `data_type`, `kind`, `output_config.scale.{name,description,color}`) are NOT sent — they're either inferred by calibrate from the parent flow (e.g. TTS implies audio) or get baked into the prompt before sending (e.g. per-level `description`s become a "Rubric:" block via `_format_scale_rubric`). For STT/TTS the payload goes to `--config <path>` as `{"evaluators": [...]}`. For simulations it lives at `config.evaluators` (replacing the old `evaluation_criteria` key). For LLM tests/benchmarks the helper `build_test_evaluators_payload` produces a deduped top-level `evaluators` list (one entry per unique evaluator UUID — names suffixed with `-{uuid8}` on collision) and per-test-case `config.test_cases[].evaluation.criteria = [{name, arguments?}]` references; the top-level prompts keep `{{variable}}` placeholders unrendered so calibrate substitutes per test case using each criterion's `arguments`. STT/TTS/simulation payloads instead pre-render variables (no per-row arguments mechanism).
- **Default prompts API** — `GET /evaluators/default-prompt?purpose={llm|stt|tts|simulation}` returns the canonical default system prompt + suggested config for prefilling the create-evaluator form. The same prompts power the seeded LLM/STT/TTS evaluators (built via `_seed_from_purpose` in [db.py](src/db.py) so `DEFAULT_PROMPTS_BY_PURPOSE` is the single source of truth). The `simulation` purpose has no seeded evaluator — its prompt is a template with a literal `<ENTER EVALUATION CRITERIA HERE>` placeholder the user replaces directly (no `{{var}}`). Default judge models: `DEFAULT_TEXT_JUDGE_MODEL` for text/STT/simulation, `DEFAULT_AUDIO_JUDGE_MODEL` for TTS.

## Conventions

- New entities: UUID primary identifier (plus auto-increment `id`), `deleted_at` soft delete, `created_at`/`updated_at` timestamps, JSON `config` column for flexible fields, validated at the API layer via Pydantic.
- Many-to-many links use dedicated pivot tables with their own soft-delete column.
- When mutating child rows (e.g. `dataset_items`), bump the parent's `updated_at` in the same transaction.
- Schema migrations on existing tables: `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN` inside `init_db()`, wrapped in `try/except sqlite3.OperationalError: pass`. Use `DEFAULT NULL` — SQLite silently rejects non-constant defaults like `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` in `ADD COLUMN`, and the `except` will swallow the failure.
- All job failures route through `capture_exception_to_sentry()` (marks as unhandled, flushes immediately — critical for background threads).
- CLI failure detection is two-layer: non-zero exit code **or** expected structured output missing. Never treat stderr content as a failure signal — the calibrate CLI emits benign cleanup tracebacks.
